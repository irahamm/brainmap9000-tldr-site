                <p class="p_paragraph"><u>Disclaimer</u>: You cannot do this by solely using 'brainmap9000'.</p>
                <p class="p_paragraph">In order to add a new area to the map, you'll first need to draw this area in the map using some vector graphics
                painting software. I recommend you to use Inkscape. It's completely free and simple to use.
                You can download it using this link:<a href="https://inkscape.org/release/">https://inkscape.org/release/</a></p>
                <p class="p_paragraph">After downloading Inkscape, open the 'map1.svg' file in Inkscape. This file is located in brainmap.9000's directory.
                You should see something like this:</p>
                <img src="instruction images3/שקופית1.JPG">
                <p class="p_paragraph">Click the pencil tool (tools are located on the right side):</p>

                <p class="p_paragraph">Choose a stroke and fill. <strong>Hold SHIFT+click</strong> a color to choose a <strong>stroke</strong>.
                    <strong>Click</strong> on color regularly to choose a <strong>fill</strong>. There are some colors
                to choose from on the bottom.</p>
                <img src="instruction images3/שקופית3.JPG">
                <p class="p_paragraph">Hold the mouse to draw your area...<br>
                Important TIP: if you want to draw more complex shapes (such as a cortex for example), use the pencil/pen
                    to draw only the outline (black stroke, transparent fill), then use the paint bucket tool.</p>
                <img src="instruction images2/שקופית5.JPG">
                <p class="p_paragraph">After finishing, you should see your area appear within the "Layers and Objects" portion on the right.
                It should have a name like "path(somenumber)"-</p>
                <img src="instruction images2/שקופית6.JPG">

                Click the button. The window should now display a list of areas. One of those areas is the area you've added.</p>
